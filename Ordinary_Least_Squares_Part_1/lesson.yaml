   This lesson will make use of the **tidyverse**, **vtable**, and **fixest** packages.
   
   So make sure those are installed first!
   
   If they're not installed, you can hit Escape or type bye() to exit this course now and then install them with install.packages(c('tidyverse','vtable','fixest')) before starting back up. You can re-enter the course by typing swirl()

   Let's start by loading up the packages we'll need. 
 
   Use the library() function to load the tidyverse package.
  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyverse)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(tidyverse)')
  Hint: Take the name of the package and feed that to the library() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Great! Now do vtable.
  CorrectAnswer: library(vtable)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(vtable)')
  Hint: Take the name of the package and feed that to the library() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   And finally fixest.
  CorrectAnswer: library(fixest)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(fixest)')
  Hint: Take the name of the package and feed that to the library() function.

  Output: |-
   Now we are going to load in some data.
   
   There are two main ways to load in data: from *file* or from a *package*.
   
   Let's work from a package first.
   
   Many packages come with data pre-loaded. You can see what data sets are there by typing data( and seeing what pops up.
   
   For now, load up the pre-loaded data set mtcars using the data() function.
  CorrectAnswer: data(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data(mtcars)','data("mtcars")')
  Hint: Take the name of the data set, mtcars, and feed that to the data() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   When data comes from a package, it shows up as an object with the name you called it as.
   
   Also, data you get this way often comes with a help file.
   
   Use help(mtcars) to see descriptions of all the variables.
  CorrectAnswer: help(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just type help(mtcars).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Let's look at the data in other ways too.
   
   Try clicking on the data object in the Environment window to look at it like a spreadsheet.
   
  CorrectAnswer: View(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just click on "mtcars" in the Environment tab in the top-right. Or, type View(mtcars).


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Then, send it to the vtable() function to get information on all the variables.
  CorrectAnswer: vtable(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('vtable')
  Hint: Take the name of the data set, mtcars, and send it to the vtable() function.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the highest value that the cyl variable takes?
  CorrectAnswer: 8
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=8)
  Hint: Look at the "Values" column of the vtable. Or if you prefer, do max(mtcars$cyl).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   The other way to get data into R is by loading it from a file.
   
   The file could be on your computer or could be online.
   
   Generally, this requires you take the file path or URL and make it into a string by putting quotes around it ('' or "").
   
   We're going to be getting our data file from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/USFinanceIndustry.csv
   
   Turn that URL into a string using quotes.
  CorrectAnswer: "'https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/USFinanceIndustry.csv'"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/USFinanceIndustry.csv')
  Hint: Just type a quote (' or "), then paste in the URL, then put the same ending quote.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now put that string into the read_csv() function (from the tidyverse).
   
   NOTE: read_csv() is different from, and usually better than, the base R function read.csv. Use read_csv, not read.csv!
   
   This will read the data from the internet. However, we also need to *store* the data as an object in R.
   
   So use <- or = to save the data as df.
  CorrectAnswer: df <- read_csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/USFinanceIndustry.csv')
  AnswerTests: min(names(df)  == names(suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(read_csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/USFinanceIndustry.csv'))))) == 1
  Hint: |- 
   We know we can store objects using the format
   
   a <- 2
   
   which stores the number 2 in the object a.
   
   Now we want to store the results of our read_csv() function in the object df.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now let's finally build a regression.
   
   At its core, a regression in R requires two things: a formula and a data set.
   
   We have the data set, so let's make a formula.
   
   A formula in R (when you have only two variables) is of the format
   
   Y ~ X
   
   where Y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable.
   
   Create a formula where mpg is the dependent variable and hp is the independent variable. Put it in quotes for now.
  CorrectAnswer: mpg ~ hp
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mpg~hp','mpg ~ hp','mpg~ hp','mpg ~hp')
  Hint: Just rewrite Y ~ X but with mpg in place of Y and hp in place of X. Then put it in quotes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now we can put that formula into the feols() function from fixest to run a regression.
   
   Use the feols() function. Put the mpg ~ hp formula in there first (without quotes).
   
   Then, specify data = mtcars, since you're using the mtcars data set.
  CorrectAnswer: feols(mpg~hp, data = mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=feols(mpg~hp, data = mtcars))
  Hint: feols() takes two arguments here. The first is mpg~hp. Then put a comma to separate the arguments. Then data = mtcars.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: In this OLS line, what is the slope on hp? Round to the thousandths place (.001)
  CorrectAnswer: -.068
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=-.068)
  Hint: The slope coefficient for hp is listed underneath hp on the regression output.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |- 
   In the mtcars data, "mpg" is the miles per gallon of a particular car, and "hp" is the horsepower of that car.
  
   The slope on hp is -.068 in this regression. How can we interpret this?

  AnswerChoices: When hp = 0, we predict that mpg = -.068.; A decrease in hp of -.068 is associated with a one-unit increase in mpg.; An increase in hp of one standard deviation is associated with a -.068 decrease in mpg.; An increase in hp of one unit is associated with a -.068 decrease in mpg.
  CorrectAnswer: An increase in hp of one unit is associated with a -.068 decrease in mpg.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='An increase in hp of one unit is associated with a -.068 decrease in mpg.')
  Hint: Think about how you would normally interpret the slope coefficient in a line.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |- 
   In the mtcars data, "mpg" is the miles per gallon of a particular car, and "hp" is the horsepower of that car.
  
   The intercept is 30.10 in this regression. How can we interpret this?

  AnswerChoices: When hp = 0, we predict that mpg = 30.10.; A decrease in hp of 30.10 is associated with a one-unit increase in mpg.; An increase in hp of one standard deviation is associated with a 30.10 increase in mpg.; An increase in hp of one unit is associated with a 30.10 increase in mpg.
  CorrectAnswer: When hp = 0, we predict that mpg = 30.10.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='When hp = 0, we predict that mpg = 30.10.')
  Hint: Think about how you would normally interpret the slope coefficient in a line.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Most of the time, we want to see a fuller description of the regression, not just the coefficients.

   For this, we will need to store our regression object so we can pass it to other functions.

   Rerun the same regression as in the last step, but save it to the object my_model.
  CorrectAnswer: my_model <- feols(mpg~hp, data = mtcars)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('my_model'),class(my_model) == 'fixest' & identical(predict(my_model), predict(feols(mpg~hp, data = mtcars))),FALSE)
  Hint: Take the feols() function you used in the last step (you can just hit the up key to reuse the code) and use <- to store it as my_model.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Let's look at a table summarizing the regression.

   First, write the name of the model itself to summarize your regression.
   
   (note if you were using the base-R lm() instead of feols(), you'd need summary() instead just just writing the model name)
  CorrectAnswer: my_model
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_model')
  Hint: Type my_model.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, let's get a nicer look using etable() from the fixest package.
  CorrectAnswer: etable(my_model)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('etable')
  Hint: Take your my_model object and put it in the function etable().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now let's get a nice graph of our regression results using ggplot() from the tidyverse package.
   
   Fill in the appropriate x and y-axis variables for your data:
   
   ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = xaxisvariable, y = yaxisvariable)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = xaxisvariable, y = yaxisvariable)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = xaxisvariable, y = yaxisvariable)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm'))
  Hint: Just fill in the appropriate axis values.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Don't think we forgot about that data we loaded in with df earlier!

   We are going to look at how corporate profits predict finanical-sector profits.
   
   Use feols() to run a regression using the df data with Financial as the dependent variable and CorporateProfitsAdj as the independent variable, and save it as reg2.
  CorrectAnswer: reg2 <- feols(Financial ~ CorporateProfitsAdj, data = df)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('reg2'),class(reg2) == 'fixest' & identical(predict(reg2), predict(feols(Financial ~ CorporateProfitsAdj, data = df))),FALSE)
  Hint: Use the exact same code as with the mtcars regression, but now the data is df, we have Financial instead of mpg, and we have CorporateProfitsAdj instead of hp.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Just as one last thing, we're going to do something strange.
   
   Use the following code to add a new variable called ProfitsHalf that divides CorporateProfitsAdj by 2 and save it as the new data set df2:
   
   df2 <- df %>%
       mutate(ProfitsHalf = CorporateProfitsAdj/2)
  CorrectAnswer: df <- df %>%
       mutate(ProfitsHalf = CorporateProfitsAdj/2)
  AnswerTests: identical(df2, df %>% mutate(ProfitsHalf = CorporateProfitsAdj/2))
  Hint: Just copy in the code!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now regress Financial on ProfitsHalf with feols() using the df2 data set and store the result as reg3.
  CorrectAnswer: reg3 <- feols(Financial ~ ProfitsHalf, data = df2)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('reg3'),class(reg3) == 'feols' & identical(predict(reg3), predict(feols(Financial ~ ProfitsHalf, data = df2))),FALSE)
  Hint: Use the exact same regression code as last time but use data = df2 nowand replace CorporateProfitsAdj with ProfitsHalf. Did you forget to save it as reg3? If you accidentally overwrite reg2 you might want to re-make it first.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Put both reg2 and reg3 into etable() so you can look at the results side-by-side.
  CorrectAnswer: etable(reg2, reg3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=etable(reg2, reg3))
  Hint: Just type etable(reg2, reg3)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |- 
   The coefficient on ProfitsHalf in Model 2 (from df2) is exactly twice as large as the coefficient on CorporateProfitsAdj in Model 1 (from df).
   
   Why does this doubling make sense?

  AnswerChoices: Because the meaning of "a one unit change in X" has doubled; Because of sampling variation; Because OLS uses squared residuals, leading to the coefficient being doubled; Because when the variable has halved, the line had to move down to accommodate it
  CorrectAnswer: Because the meaning of "a one unit change in X" has doubled
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Because the meaning of "a one unit change in X" has doubled')
  Hint: Think about what the slope coefficient in OLS means in terms of the X variable.
