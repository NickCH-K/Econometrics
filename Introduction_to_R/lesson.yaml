   Welcome to the Swirl econometrics course.
   
   This first lesson is just to get you familiar with R. We will be covering:
   
   a. How objects work
   
   b. Building a vector
   
   c. Using a data frame
   
   d. Getting a variable out of a data frame
   
   e. Using a function (and reading its help file)
   
   f. The pipe %>%
   
   g. The dplyr commands pull(), filter(), select(), and mutate()
   
   Before starting, you should have the **tidyverse** package installed. If you don't, Escape out of here and type install.packages('tidyverse')
   
   If you get stuck, you can skip a question (and see the answer) by writing skip(). But use this sparingly or you won't learn anything!

   OBJECTS
   
   In R, just about everything is an *object*. Numbers are objects, functions are objects, data is an object, analyses are objects!
   
   Objects sit in memory (look over in the Environment pane to see what's loaded).
   
   We can: (1) create objects, (2) manipulate objects with functions, and (3) look at objects.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Let's start by making an object.
   
   We can assign objects using <-
   
   a <- 1
   
   will create an object a and put the number 1 in that object. 
   
   a = 1 works too but that's not how the cool kids do it B)
   
   Store the number 100 in an object called d.
  CorrectAnswer: d <- 100
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('d'),d == 100,FALSE)
  Hint: Type d <- 100.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Once we have an object we may want to look at its contents.
   
   For something simple like d we can just look in the Environment pane and see that it's 32. But that won't work once we get to more complex stuff.
   
   A standard way to look at the contents of an object is to just put it on a line by itself. The code:
   
   a
   
   Will show you the contents of a. As will:
   
   print(a)
   
   Have R show you the contents of d.
  CorrectAnswer: d   
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('d','print(d)')
  Hint: Just type d.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   So we've created an object and looked at it. Now we want to manipulate that object with a function.
   
   Let's take the logarithm of d.
   
   Use help(log) to look at the help file for the log function.
  CorrectAnswer: help(log)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(log)')
  Hint: Type help(log)

- Class: text
  Output: |-
   Let's parse out what we see here:
   
   (a) Up at the top we have a description of the function and what it does.
   
   (b) Then we have "Usage" which shows us the *arguments* the function takes and the order they go in (it's always functionname(argument,argument,argument))
   
   (c) Then it describes what its arguments mean - x should be a number or complex vector (it will take a single number too), and base should be a single number.
   
   (d) If you scroll down, there are Details on the funciton, a description of the kind of object you'll get back (Value)
   
   (e) And crucially, some Examples of how the function can be used!
   
   Explore the help file before moving on.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Take the natural logarithm of d.
   
   Two things to note while doing this:
   
   (a) The default base is exp(1), i.e. the base of a natural logarithm. Because it's the default value you can ignore it and don't need to set it yourself).
   
   (b) As long as you give the arguments *in order*, you don't need to name them explicitly. Since the arguments are log(x,base), if you just said log(10,2), it would know that x = 10 and base = 2 without you specifying log(x=10,base=2).
  CorrectAnswer: log(d)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=log(d))
  Hint: Take d and put it as the first argument of log().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now take the logarithm of d with base 10. Use the log() function, don't calculate it yourself!
  CorrectAnswer: log(d,10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=log(d,10)); (expr_uses_func('log') | expr_uses_func('log10'))
  Hint: Take d and pass it as the first argument of log(). Then make 10 the second argument.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we've taken the logarithm of d, have R show you the contents of d again.
  CorrectAnswer: d
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('d','print(d)')
  Hint: Just type d.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Notice that even though we took the logarithm of it, d didn't change, it's still 100.
   
   If you want to manipulate an object *and keep the changed version*, you need to save that manipulated object as an object, either making it a new object or writing over the old one.
   
   Save the base-10 logarithm of d as a new object, d_log
  CorrectAnswer: d_log <- log(d, 10)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('d_log'),d_log == log(d,10),FALSE)
  Hint: Take the base-10 log code you had and then use <- to save it as an object called d_log.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   d and d_log are both single numbers. But in econometrics we're generally working with LOTS of observations of the same thing.
   
   We can collect multiple objects of the same type into *vectors*
   
   For example, 1:10 would create a vector with the numbers from 1 to 10.
   
   We can also create vectors with the c() function (concatenate). c(1,2,3,4) makes a vector object with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   
   Make a vector with the numbers 5, 8, 1, 3, 100 and call that vector my_vec.
  CorrectAnswer: my_vec <- c(5, 8, 1, 3, 100)
  AnswerTests: identical(my_vec,c(5, 8, 1, 3, 100))
  Hint: Create the vector by putting the numbers into the c() function, then save it as my_vec with <-

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Once you have a vector, you can send that vector to a function that takes vectors as an argument.
   
   Use mean() to get the mean of my_vec
  CorrectAnswer: mean(my_vec)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=mean(my_vec)); expr_uses_func('mean')
  Hint: Take my_vec and pass it as the first argument of mean().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   You can also use indexing to access the elements of the vector with square brackets []
   
   a_vec[3:4] would get the third and fourth elements of the a_vec vector
   
   a_vec[c(5,3,1)] would get the fifth, third, and first elements, in that order.
   
   Use indexing to get the third and fifth elements of my_vec.
  CorrectAnswer: my_vec[c(3,5)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vec[c(3,5)]')
  Hint: c(3,5) gives you a vector with 3 and 5 in it. Feed that into square brackets following my_vec to get the third and fifth elements of my_vec.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   You can also get elements of a vector by feeding it *logical values* (TRUE and FALSE)
   
   a_vec[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)], if a_vec had three elements, would give you the first element (TRUE), not the second (FALSE), and the third (TRUE).
   
   Use this method to get the first, third, and fifth elements of my_vec.
  CorrectAnswer: my_vec[c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_vec[c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)]')
  Hint: The vector c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE) is TRUE for its first, third, and fifth elements. Feed that to the square brackets following my_vec to get its first, third, and fifth elements.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   A data frame is a collection of vectors of the same length. Data frames is what we'll be using for most of the work in this class.
   
   There are a few ways to get a data frame object. One is to use a pre-loaded data set like "iris" which has data on some flowers. Type:
   
   data(iris)
   
   to load it in.
  CorrectAnswer: data(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(iris)')
  Hint: Just type data(iris)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now type iris by itself to look at the iris data object.
  CorrectAnswer: iris
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris')
  Hint: Just type iris.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   As mentioned, data frames are just a bunch of vectors of the same length taped together.
   
   We can get those vectors back out with $ or [[]]
   
   my_data$vec1
   
   my_data[['vec1']]
   
   will both get the column named vec1 out of the my_data data frame.
   
   Get the Petal.Length column out of iris using the $
  CorrectAnswer: iris$Petal.Length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris$Petal.Length')
  Hint: It's my_data$vec1 but with iris instead of my_data and Petal.Length instead of vec1.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   After we get a vector back out of a data frame, we can send it to a function that uses vectors.
   
   Get the mean() of Petal.Length from the iris data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(iris$Petal.Length)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=mean(iris$Petal.Length))
  Hint: Take your iris$Petal.Length code from last time and use it as the first argument of mean().

- Class: exact_question
  Output: |-
   What would be the output of the following lines of code?
   
   my_first_vector <- c(1,6,5,2,3)
   
   my_second_vector <- my_first_vector[c(1,4,5)]
   
   my_second_vector[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
  CorrectAnswer: 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 2)
  Hint: my_second_vector contains the first, fourth, and fifth elements of my_first_vector.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   In this class, most of the time we're going to be working with data frames using the **dplyr** package, which is a part of the **tidyverse**.
   
   **dplyr** has a bunch of data-manipulation functions in it that chain together easily and have nice syntax.
   
   Load up the **tidyverse** so we can use **dplyr** by typing
   
   library(tidyverse)
  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyverse)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(tidyverse)')
  Hint: Type library(tidyverse)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   **dplyr** has an alternate way of getting a vector out of a data frame, the function pull()
   
   pull() takes two argument: first, the data frame, and second, the variable you want.
   
   It's very flexible. You can ask for the variable by name directly, as a string, or as a column position
   
   pull(my_data, vec1)
   
   pull(my_data, 'vec1')
   
   pull(my_data, 3)
   
   Would all get the vec1 column out of the my_data data frame (that third one requires it to be the third column)
   
   Use pull() to get the Petal.Length variable out of iris.
  CorrectAnswer: pull(iris, Petal.Length)
  AnswerTests: check_equality_of_vector(pull(iris, Petal.Length)); expr_uses_func('pull')
  Hint: Make iris the first argument of pull, and Petal.Length the second.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Another handy **dplyr** function is filter(), which picks particular rows out of a data frame. Feed it a logical vector (like the c(TRUE, FALSE, ...) we had before, or something like Petal.Length > 5 which would be TRUE wherever Petal.Length is longer than 5) and it will give you back just the *rows* that are TRUE.
   
   filter(my_data, vec1 == 3)
   
   would give you back a data frame (or "tibble" which is just a data frame with some extra bells and whistles) containing just the rows/observations for which vec1 is 3 (the == checks for whether they're equal).
   
   Use filter() to get only the rows of iris for which Species is 'virginica'. Species is a string variable so you'll need those quotes around Virginica.
  CorrectAnswer: filter(iris, Species == 'virginica')
  AnswerTests: check_equality_of_data(filter(iris, Species == 'virginica')); expr_uses_func('filter')
  Hint: filter() takes iris as the first argument, and the logical statement Species == 'virginica' as the second argument.


- Class: text
  Output: |-
   One of the most useful things that comes with **dplyr** is the pipe, %>%
   
   The pipe takes whatever is on its left and makes it the first argument of the thing on the right, so you can chain things together like a conveyer belt.
   
   This makes your code easier to write, easier to read, and less likely to have parentheses-balancing issues.
   
   For example, these are two different ways of saying "pull the variable Petal.Length out of the iris data":
   
   pull(iris, Petal.Length)
   
   iris %>%
   
      pull(Petal.Length)
   
   (the pipe isn't too impressive with just one command like this, but we'll get there!)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the pipe (%>%) with pull() to get the Sepal.Length variable.
  CorrectAnswer: |-
   iris %>%
   
   pull(Sepal.Length) 
  AnswerTests: check_equality_of_vector(iris %>% pull(Sepal.Length)) ; expr_uses_func('`%>%`'); expr_uses_func('pull')
  Hint: Follow the pipe code from the last question, but change what you're pulling.

   
- Class: text
  Output: |-
   The pipe really starts to shine when you have a lot of operations to get through. For example, these are two different ways of saying "give me the minimum value of Petal.Length among Virginica flowers":
   
   min(pull(filter(iris, Species == 'Virginica'),Petal.Length))
   
   iris %>%
   
      filter(Species == 'Virginica') %>%
      
      pull(Petal.Length)%>%
      
      min()
      
   Since the first argument of **dplyr** functions is always the data frame, we don't need to write it; the pipe just fills that in with whatever's on the left!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the pipe (%>%) with filter() and pull() to get the mean of the variable Sepal.Length after filtering to just the observations for which Petal.Length > median(Petal.Length).
  CorrectAnswer: |-
   iris %>%
   
   filter(Petal.Length > median(Petal.Length)) %>%
   
   pull(Sepal.Length) %>%
   
   mean()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= iris %>% filter(Petal.Length > median(Petal.Length)) %>% pull(Sepal.Length) %>% mean()) ; expr_uses_func('`%>%`'); expr_uses_func('filter'); expr_uses_func('pull')
  Hint: Follow the pipe code from the last question, but change what you're filtering to, what you're pulling, and the function you send it to.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Like filter(), select() will give you back just part of your data.frame (or tibble).
   
   Except instead of picking just some of the rows, it will pick just some of the columns.
   
   my_data %>% select(vec1, vec2)
   
   will give you back a version of my_data that contains only the columns vec1 and vec2. Unlike pull() you get back a data frame, not a vector, even if you only specify one variable.
   
   Use select() to pick only the columns Species, Sepal.Length, and Petal.Length from iris.
  CorrectAnswer: iris %>% select(Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)
  AnswerTests: check_equality_of_data(iris %>% select(Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length))
  Hint: The first argument for select() is the data frame (either put in directly or passed via pipe). Then just list the variables you want.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Of course, as with all of these, if you don't store the result it doesn't do much!
   
   Repeat the code from the last step, but this time use <- to overwrite the iris object with this new, three-variable-only version.
   
  CorrectAnswer: iris <- iris %>% select(Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)
  AnswerTests: identical(names(iris),c('Species','Sepal.Length','Petal.Length'))
  Hint: Just iris <-  and then the code from the last step.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   While there are many more **dplyr** functions, our final one for today will be mutate().
   
   mutate() *adds a new column* to the data.
   
   my_data %>% mutate(newvarname = functionofoldvars)
   
   (note that even though we're assigning things we have to use = not <- here). For example,
   
   my_data %>% mutate(new1 = var1^2, new2 = var1 > 3)
   
   would create two new variables in my_data called new1, equal to var1 squared, and new2 equal to TRUE if var1 is above 3 and FALSE otherwise.
   
   Use mutate() to create a new column called Petal_Squared equal to Petal.Length^2. **Overwrite iris with this modified version**
  CorrectAnswer: iris <- iris %>% mutate(Petal_Squared = Petal.Length^2)
  AnswerTests: identical(iris$Petal_Squared, (iris$Petal.Length)^2)
  Hint: The variable creation syntax inside of mutate is new_variable_name = function_of_old_variables.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Use data(Orange) to load up some data on tree circumferences. Then it will be the last question I promise!
  CorrectAnswer: data(Orange)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(Orange)')
  Hint: Just type data(Orange)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Orange has three variables: Tree, age, and Circumference.
   
   Using %>%, filter(), select(), mutate(), pull(), and mean() (you'll need all of them):
   
   (a) Pick just the rows where Tree is 5
   
   (b) Pick just the columns age and circumference
   
   (c) Create a new column called circ_by_age which is circumference divided by age
   
   (d) Pull that new variable out
   
   (e) Take the mean of it
   
   Then you're done!
 
  CorrectAnswer: |-
   Orange %>%
   
   filter(Tree == 5) %>%
   
   select(age, circumference) %>%
   
   mutate(circ_by_age = circumference/age) %>%
   
   pull(circ_by_age) %>%
   
   mean()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= Orange %>% filter(Tree == 5) %>% select(age, circumference) %>%  mutate(circ_by_age = circumference/age) %>%   pull(circ_by_age) %>%   mean()); expr_uses_func('`%>%`'); expr_uses_func('select'); expr_uses_func('filter'); expr_uses_func('mutate'); expr_uses_func('pull')
  Hint: Use the appropriate functions according to the instructions and chain them together using the pipe. Keep in mind that the mean() at the end of the chain won't need anything in the parentheses, since the only argument it needs is the vector, and that's being passed in by the pipe!
