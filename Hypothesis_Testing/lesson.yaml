  Output: |-
   This lesson will cover hypothesis testing, both in concept and how to do it in R.
   
   Before starting, you will want to be sure that the packages tidyverse, fixest, ggstance, vtable, and multcomp are all installed.
   
   If they're not, you can Escape out of here, install them with
   
   install.packages(c('tidyverse','fixest','ggstance','vtable','multcomp'))
   
   And then type swirl() to come back in.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load in the tidyverse with library(tidyverse)  
  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyverse)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(tidyverse)')
  Hint: Just put library(tidyverse). If that doesn't work, maybe it's not installed?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load in fixest with library(fixest)  
  CorrectAnswer: library(fixest)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(fixest)')
  Hint: Just put library(fixest). If that doesn't work, maybe it's not installed?

   Let's create some data for which we know "the truth".
   
   Copy-paste this in:
   
   # create the data with tibble() and mutate()
   df <- tibble(X = runif(300)) %>% mutate(Y = 5 + 3*X + rnorm(300))
  CorrectAnswer: |-
   set.seed(1000)
   df <- tibble(X = runif(300)) %>% mutate(Y = 5 + 3*X + rnorm(300))
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('df'),identical(names(df),c('X','Y')),FALSE)
  Hint: Copy-paste in all the code.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: |- 
   In the code you just ran, you set the *true* data generating process for Y using mutate. 
   
   What is the *true* value of beta1 (the effect of a one-unit increase in X on Y)?
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=3)
  Hint: |- 
   The mutate command has
   
   mutate(Y = 5 + 3*X + rnorm(300))
   
   And the true data generating process looks like
   
   Y = beta0 + beta1*X + error

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use feols() to run a regression of Y on X using your data df (which is just a single sample generated using the true DGP) and store the result as one_samp
  CorrectAnswer: one_samp <- feols(Y~X, data = df)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('one_samp'),(class(one_samp) == 'fixest') & identical(predict(one_samp),predict(feols(Y~X, data = df))),FALSE)
  Hint: Use feols() (not lm()) to run a regression of Y on X, with data = df, and store the result using <- as one_samp

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   You can get just the named vector of coefficients out of a regression object using the coef() function.
   
   You can then get the specific coefficient you want using [['variablename']] . Store the coefficient on X as beta1:
   
   beta1 <- coef(one_samp)[['X']]
   
   (usually for a vector you'd just need single brackets [] but we want to get rid of that name)
  CorrectAnswer: beta1 <- coef(one_samp)[['X']]
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('beta1'),identical(beta1,beta1 <- coef(one_samp)[['X']]),FALSE)
  Hint: Just copy in beta1 <- coef(one_samp)[['X']]

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   You can get just the vector of standard errors from a feols regression with model$se, and get the standard error for the specific coefficient you want with the same [['variablename']] method we just used for the coefficient.

   Use this code to get the standard error of beta1 and store it:
   
   se_beta1 <- one_samp$se[['X']]
  CorrectAnswer: se_beta1 <- one_samp$se[['X']]
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('se_beta1'),identical(se_beta1,se_beta1 <- one_samp$se[['X']]),FALSE)
  Hint: Copy in the code


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now have R show you the value of beta1
  CorrectAnswer: beta1
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('beta1','print(beta1)')
  Hint: Just write beta1 or print(beta1)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: beta1 is not exactly 3. What is this an example of? 
  AnswerChoices: Sampling variation; Endogeneity; Both sampling variation and endogeneity; Not enough information
  CorrectAnswer: Sampling variation
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Sampling variation')
  Hint: When we created the data, we didn't make X and the error term related to each other.


- Class: mult_question
  Output: We are going to perform a hypothesis test on beta1, which was estimated from a sample of 300 observations. What would be the most appropriate null distribution to use?
  AnswerChoices: Normal; t distribution; F distribution 
  CorrectAnswer: Normal
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Normal')
  Hint: There are enough observations here that the t distribution is not necessary.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Keeping in mind that you've already got the coefficient saved as beta1 and the standard error saved as se_beta1, calculate the z-score for a test of whether beta1 = 3.
  CorrectAnswer: (beta1 - 3)/se_beta1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=c('X'=(beta1 - 3)/se_beta1))
  Hint: The formula for a z-score is (estimate - null value)/s.e.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: |-
   In a moment we're going to calculate the proportion of the standard normal distribution that is to the right of the *absolute value* of your z-score.
   
   In order to reject the null at the 95% confidence level with a *two-sided* test, or in other words to get a p-value of .05 or less, this proportion needs to be below...
   
   (put your answer as a decimal, i.e. .4 instead of 40%)
  CorrectAnswer: .025
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.025)
  Hint: For a 95% confidence level and a two-sided test, to reject the null you want 5% in *both tails*, meaning how much in *just one* tail?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   You can get the proportion of the distribution to the right of the absolute value of a z-score with the pnorm function.
   
   pnorm(z) gives the proportion of the standard normal that is to the left of z, so 1-pnorm(z) gives the proportion to the right. So keeping in mind we want to use the absolute value:
   
   1-pnorm(abs(z))
   
   Use this to find the proportion to the right of the absolute value of your z-score.
  CorrectAnswer: 1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1)))
  Hint: Take your z-score code from before, (beta1-3)/se_beta1, and use that to replace the z in the original code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So then, keeping mind that this is a two-tailed test so we want the proportion as far away from the null as your z-score, or farther, on *both sides*, what is the p-value of this test?
  CorrectAnswer: 2*(1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2*(1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1))))
  Hint: To count the area on both sides, just multiply the code for your previous answer by 2.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Can you reject the null that beta1 = 3 at the 95% level with a two-sided test?
   
   Write TRUE if you can reject the null and FALSE if you can't, in all capitals.
  CorrectAnswer: 2*(1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1))) <= .05
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2*(1-pnorm(abs((beta1-3)/se_beta1))) <= .05)
  Hint: If your answer to the last question is below .05, you can reject and so type TRUE. Otherwise, type FALSE.


- Class: exact_question
  Output: |-
   This swirl lesson uses randomly generated data, so not everyone will get the same z-score or significance.
   
   What proportion of people who use this swirl lesson will reject the null of beta1 = 3, even though it's true?
   
   (put your answer as a decimal, i.e. .4 instead of 40%)
  CorrectAnswer: .05
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=.05)
  Hint: If alpha = X, then we reject the null X of the time even when it's true, just by random chance.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we are going to work with some data. Use data(storms) to load the storms dataset (from the **dplyr** package)
  CorrectAnswer: data(storms)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(storms)')
  Hint: Type data(storms)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Use vtable() to examine the data.
   
   Hmm, we haven't actually loaded the vtable package yet. No worries, you can access the vtable function without loading the package using packagename::functionname()
   
   vtable::vtable()
  CorrectAnswer: vtable::vtable(storms)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('vtable')
  Hint: vtable::vtable()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now examine the data using help(storms)
  CorrectAnswer: help(storms)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(storms)')
  Hint: Type help(storms)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Let's see if how far east you are relates to wind speed of a storm.
   
   Use feols() to regress wind on longitude and store the result as wind_reg
  CorrectAnswer: wind_reg <- feols(wind~long, data = storms)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('wind_reg'),(class(wind_reg) == 'fixest') & identical(predict(wind_reg),predict(feols(wind~long, data =storms))),FALSE)
  Hint: C'mon, you know how to run a regression at this point. Then, store it as wind_reg.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use etable() to look at the regression.
  CorrectAnswer: etable(wind_reg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'etable(wind_reg)')
  Hint: Type etable(wind_reg)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the standard error on the coefficient on longitude?
  AnswerChoices: 53.90; 0.8984; 0.0063; 0.0134; 10010; 2.24e-5
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0134
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.0134')
  Hint: Standard errors in an etable() table are shown in parentheses to the right of the coefficients.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use coefplot() to look at the 95% confidence interval of the coefficient on longitude (called long in the regression). Use the keep option to only look at the longitude coefficient, not the intercept.
  CorrectAnswer: coefplot(wind_reg, keep = 'long')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "coefplot(wind_reg, keep = 'long')"")
  Hint: Take your regression wind_reg and give it to coefplot as its first argument. Then add a keep option set to long, with quotes around long.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: The asterisks indicate whether the p-value on a test of the coefficient is below a certain value. Based on the three stars next to the Intercept, we can reject at the 99% level that the intercept is equal to the null value of... what?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0)
  Hint: Regression tables by default compare their coefficients to 0.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Use wald() from fixest to test whether the coefficient on longitude is 0.
   
   The first argument in wald is the regression object. The second is a string vector of the names of the variables you want to compare to 0.
  CorrectAnswer: wald(wind_reg, 'long')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="wald(wind_reg, 'long')")
  Hint: Make the first argument wind_reg and the second 'long'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load the multcomp library using library(multcomp) 
  CorrectAnswer: library(multcomp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(multcomp)')
  Hint: Type library(car)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now use glht() from multcomp to test whether the coefficient on longitude is equal to 5. Now, instead of just listing the variable name in the second argument, write your null hypothesis, for example X = 10 would test the null that the coefficient on X is equal to 10.
   
   You'll also need to pass glht to summary(). A good format for doing all of this would look like:
   
   mymodel %>% glht('X = 10') %>% summary()
  CorrectAnswer: wind_reg %>% glht('long = 5') %>% summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="wind_reg %>% glht('long = 5') %>% summary()")
  Hint: Take wind_reg, pass that with a pipe to glht with the argument 'long = 5', then pass that through another pipe to summary().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   What if we have heteroskedasticity? Rerun your code from the previous step, but instead of sending wind_reg directly, take your wind_reg code feols(wind~long, data = storms) and add a vcov = 'hetero' option to estimate heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
  CorrectAnswer: feols(wind~long, data = storms, vcov = 'hetero') %>% glht('long = 5') %>% summary()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="feols(wind~long, data = storms, vcov = 'hetero') %>% glht('long = 5') %>% summary()")
  Hint: Copy/paste your answer from the previous step. Then replace wind_reg with feols(wind~long, data = storms). Then, after data = storms, add vcov = 'hetero'.
