   For this lesson you will need the packages **tidyverse**, **Ecdat**, **jtools**, **huxtable**, and **vtable**
   
   If you don't have these, you'll need to install them. You can Escape or bye() out of this, install them with install.packages(c('tidyverse','Ecdat','jtools','huxtable','vtable')), and then swirl() to get back in.
   
   If you've already done Ordinary Least Squares Part 1, the only one you might not still have is Ecdat. You can install that with install.packages('Ecdat')

   Next let's load our libraries. You can just copy/paste the text below, or type skip() and all the libraries will be loaded.

   library(tidyverse)
   
   library(Ecdat)
   
   library(vtable)
   
   library(jtools)
  CorrectAnswer: |-
   library(tidyverse)
   
   library(Ecdat)
   
   library(vtable)
   
   library(jtools)
  AnswerTests: sum(paste0('package:',c('tidyverse','Ecdat','vtable','jtools')) %in% search()) == 4
  Hint: Copy/paste! Or just type skip()

  Output: |- 
   Let's load up some data to work with.
   
   Load up the MedExp data from the Ecdat package. This has information on medical expenditures made by individuals.
  CorrectAnswer: data(MedExp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(MedExp)')
  Hint: Just type data(MedExp)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   As always, we want to explore our data.
   
   This data came from a package, so it has a help file. Type help(MedExp) to look at the help file.
  CorrectAnswer: help(MedExp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(MedExp)')
  Hint: Just type help(MedExp).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   In this data, we are going to be looking at the relationship between age and med (medical expenditures).
   
   You can limit the data to just the variables you want with select() from the dplyr package (in **tidyverse**).
   
   For example,
   
   df <- df %>%
      select(A, B)
   
   Would take the df data, pick only the variables "A" and "B" in that data, and then overwrite the original df (with df <-)
   
   Use this to pick just the age and med variables from MedExp, and overwrite the original MedExp
  CorrectAnswer: MedExp <- MedExp %>% select(age, med)
  AnswerTests: sum(c('age','med') %in% names(MedExp)) == 2 & length(names(MedExp)) == 2
  Hint: |- 
   Take MedExp, pipe (%>%) it to the select function, and then list the variables you want to keep.
   
   If you accidentally changed MedExp in some other way, you may want to start over with data(MedExp) again.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Next, let's look a little closer at our variables.
   
   Use sumtable(MedExp) (from **vtable**) to look at some statistics of your variables.
  CorrectAnswer: sumtable(MedExp)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('sumtable')
  Hint: sumtable(MedExp) or MedExp %>% sumtable()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   It looks like the maximum of med is way way above most of the values (compare the 75th percentile to the maximum). Also, the mean is really high - above the 75th percentile, even!

   This suggests highly skewed data, with a lot of tiny values and a few really huge values (people who rack up enormous hospital bills).
   
   Let's take a look and see if that's true. Let's look at the distribution of med with
   
   ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = med)) + geom_density()
   
   Notice that this uses the MedExp data, puts med on the x-axis, and adds a density plot with geom_density().


  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = med)) + geom_density()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = med)) + geom_density())
  Hint: Just copy/paste in the ggplot code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Yeah, that's definitely a skewed distribution! Look how much weight there is on the very left, and then how long the right tail is.
   
   Often, it's hard to fit a straight line on highly skewed data, because of those way-out-there observations.
   
   Let's look at our relationship directly and see if a straight line (OLS) seems appropriate.
   
   ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = med)) + geom_point()
   
   Notice this uses the MedExp data and plots a scatterplot (geom_point()) with age on the x axis and med on the y axis.
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = med)) + geom_point()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = med)) + geom_point())
  Hint: Copy/paste the ggplot code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Looks pretty bad! Often in these kinds of cases we can get back to a straight line by taking the logarithm of the skewed variable. Let's try it.
  
   ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = log(med))) + geom_point()
   
   The only change from the last code is that the y axis has the log of med, not med itself
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = log(med))) + geom_point()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = log(med))) + geom_point())
  Hint: Copy/paste the ggplot code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Our plan now is to work with log(med) instead of med.
   
   One problem is that any observations with med = 0 won't work, since log(0) is undefined.
   
   We'll worry about this later. Let's just drop them for now with filter.
   
   df <- df %>%
      filter(X != 3)

   is **dplyr** code that will:
   
   - Check if the variable X is NOT equal to 3 (X != 3)
   
   - Then filter the observations to only keep non-3 values. (filter())
   
   Use this to keep only observations where med is not 0.
  CorrectAnswer: MedExp <- MedExp %>% filter(med != 0)
  AnswerTests: sum(MedExp$med == 0) == 0
  Hint: Take the dplyr code provided and make it about MedExp instead of df, med instead of X, and 0 instead of 3.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now we're ready for a regression.
   
   Using the MedExp data, regress log(med) on age, and save the regression object as med_age.
   
  CorrectAnswer: med_age <- lm(log(med)~age, data = MedExp)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('med_age'),identical(predict(med_age),predict(lm(log(med)~age, data = MedExp))),FALSE)
  Hint: Remember, our OLS formula is lm(Y~X, data = nameofdataset)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use export_summs() to look at the regression results.
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(med_age)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=export_summs(med_age))
  Hint: Just type export_summs(med_age).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The slope coefficient on age is 0.02. Interpret this coefficient.
  AnswerChoices: An age increase of 1 year is associated with a 0.02 increase in med.;An age increase of 1 year is associated with a 0.02 increase in log(med).; An increase in log(med) of one unit associated with a 0.02 increase in age.;An increase in med of one unit associated with a 0.02 increase in age.
  CorrectAnswer: An age increase of 1 year is associated with a 0.02 increase in log(med).
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='An age increase of 1 year is associated with a 0.02 increase in log(med).')
  Hint: We're working with log(med) as our Y variable here, not med!

- Class: text
  Output: (We'll come back to this later, but a neat tip for now is that a .02 increase in log(med) can also be thought of as a 2% increase in med! So a one year increase in age is associated with a 2% increase in medical expenditures.)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Let's get the predicted values and residuals out of the regression.
   
   Use the predict() function with med_age to get the predicted values.
  CorrectAnswer: predict(med_age)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=predict(med_age))
  Hint: Use med_age with the predict() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Let's get the sum of squared residuals for this regression.
   
   Take resid(med_age), square it, and run it through the sum() function.
  CorrectAnswer: resid(med_age)^2 %>% sum()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=resid(med_age)^2 %>% sum())
  Hint: Start with resid(med_age). Then, square it with ^2. Finally, put it all in the sum() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now let's take a look at the predictions.
   
   mutate() from **dplyr** can be used to add new variables to a data set.
   
   df <- df %>%
      mutate(newvar = 1:10)

   will add a new variable called newvar to the df data set, with the values 1 through 10.
   
   Add the predicted values to MedExp and call them pred.


  CorrectAnswer: MedExp <- MedExp %>% mutate(pred = predict(med_age))
  AnswerTests: identical(MedExp %>% pull(pred),predict(med_age))
  Hint: |- 
   Start with
   
   df <- df %>%
      mutate(newvar = 1:10)
      
   THen replace df with MedExp,
   
   newvar with pred,
   
   and 1:10 with predict(med_age).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Let's see what we get!
   
   ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = pred)) + geom_point()
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = pred)) + geom_point()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=ggplot(MedExp, aes(x = age, y = pred)) + geom_point())
  Hint: Just copy the ggplot code.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice we get a perfectly straight line - these predicted values are just following the OLS line we got!

  Output: |-
   Let's switch gears and talk about issues in the error term!
   
   We're going to create some randomly generated data that we can *know the answer* for.
   
   This is the code we're going to use:
   
   tb <- tibble(X = runif(100)) %>%
      mutate(error = rnorm(100,mean = 1.5*X, sd = X)) %>%
      mutate(Y = .2*X + error)
      
   Before we actually run an analysis, based on the way Y is constructed, what is the *true value* of beta1 (the X slope)?
  CorrectAnswer: .2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=.2)
  Hint: Look at the number that gets multiplied by X when creating Y with mutate().

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-

   This is the code we're going to use:
   
   tb <- tibble(X = runif(100)) %>%
      mutate(error = rnorm(100,mean = 1.5*X, sd = X)) %>%
      mutate(Y = .2*X + error)
      
   Before we actually run an analysis, once we *do* regress Y on X, will the coefficient on average be above .2, below .2, or exactly .2?
   
   Keep in mind: (a) the error positively affects Y, and (b) the mean = 1.5*X argument when making the error means that the higher X is, the higher the error is likely to be.
  AnswerChoices: Higher than .2;Lower than .2;Exactly .2; No way to tell
  CorrectAnswer: Higher than .2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Higher than .2')
  Hint: When X and Y are high together, that reflects both that X causes Y to increase, and that the error term is high when X is high, and the error term causes Y.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now let's actually create the data. Copy this in:
   
   tb <- tibble(X = runif(100)) %>%
      mutate(error = rnorm(100,mean = 1.5*X, sd = X)) %>%
      mutate(Y = .2*X + error)
  CorrectAnswer: |-
      tb <- tibble(X = runif(100)) %>%
         mutate(error = rnorm(100,mean = 1.5*X, sd = X)) %>%
         mutate(Y = .2*X + error)
  AnswerTests: identical(names(tb), c('X','error','Y'))
  Hint: Just copy in the code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   And now regress Y on X in the tb data.
   
   Store the regression as biased_reg
  CorrectAnswer: biased_reg <- lm(Y~X, data = tb)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('biased_reg'),identical(predict(biased_reg),predict(lm(Y~X, data = tb))),FALSE)
  Hint: Run a regression as normal, with Y ~ X, and store the result as biased_reg.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Look at the regression with export_summs() to see that the coefficient on X is indeed much higher than .2.
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(biased_reg)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=export_summs(biased_reg))
  Hint: Take biased_reg and send it to export_summs().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And now send it to effect_plot() so we can see what's going on. Be sure to include plot.points = TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: effect_plot(biased_reg, pred = 'X', plot.points = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=effect_plot(biased_reg, pred = 'X', plot.points = TRUE))
  Hint: Take biased_reg and send it to effect_plot(). We want pred to be X and plot.point = TRUE.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The effect plot is revealing an assumption that we've violated! What is it?
  AnswerChoices: The plot shows that X is endogenous.; The plot shows heteroskedasticity.; The plot shows clustering.; The plot shows a negative relationship.; The plot shows that we haven't minimized the sum of squared residuals.
  CorrectAnswer: The plot shows heteroskedasticity.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The plot shows heteroskedasticity.')
  Hint: We can't actually see endogeneity on a graph, we have to think about sources of endogeniety. What *can* we see on the graph?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Since the variance of the residuals changes for different values of X, we have heteroskedasticity.
   
   This will only fix the heteroskedasticity, not the endogeneity, but run export_summs() again, this time with robust = TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(biased_reg, robust = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=export_summs(biased_reg, robust = TRUE))
  Hint: It's the same export_summs() code you already used, but with the robust = TRUE option.

- Class: text
  Output: |- 
   Well done!
   
   We don't have clustering here, but if we had wanted cluster-robust standard errors, instead of
   
   export_summs(biased_reg, robust = TRUE)
   
   we could have done
   
   export_summs(biased_reg, cluster = C)
   
   where C is the name of the variable we think the errors are clustered within.
