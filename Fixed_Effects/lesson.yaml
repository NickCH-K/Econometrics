   This Swirl lesson will cover the various features on the right-hand-side of the regression equation, including binary and categorical variables, variable transformations, and interactions.
   
   This lesson will make use of the **tidyverse**, **vtable**, **car**, **jtools**, **estimatr**, and **wooldridge** packages.
   
   If you don't have these, exit out of this lesson with bye(), install the packages with
   
   install.packages(c('tidyverse','vtable','car','jtools','wooldridge','estimatr'),dependencies = TRUE)
   
   And then come back in with swirl()

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And finally load wooldridge
  CorrectAnswer: library(wooldridge)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(wooldridge)')
  Hint: Just type library(wooldridge)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now load the mathpnl data set from the **wooldridge** package with data(mathpnl)
  CorrectAnswer: data(mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(mathpnl)')
  Hint: Just type data(mathpnl)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use help(mathpnl) to look at the description of the data and to see the  variables and what they are.
  CorrectAnswer: help(mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(mathpnl)')
  Hint: Just type help(mathpnl)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   We are only going to be working with a few variables:
   
   distid: the district identifier (our "individual" for fixed effects)
   
   year: the year the data is from
   
   math4: the percentage of 4th grade students who are "satisfactory" or better in math
   
   expp: expenditure per pupil
   
   lunch: the percentage of students eligible for free lunch
   
   Use select() from dplyr to pick just these variables from mathpnl, overwriting the original mathpnl
  CorrectAnswer: mathpnl <- mathpnl %>% select(distid, year, math4, expp, lunch)
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var('mathpnl'); expr_uses_func('select'); ncol(mathpnl) == 5; sum(c('distid','year','math4','expp','lunch') %in% names(mathpnl)) == 5
  Hint: select() takes the data set as an argument, followed by the names of the variables you want to keep. Remember to use <- or = to overwrite the original mathpnl!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Click on the data to look at it.
  CorrectAnswer: View(mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(mathpnl)')
  Hint: Click on the data in the Environment tab, or type View(mathpnl)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How can we tell by looking at it that this is a panel data set?
  AnswerChoices: It has multiple rows per distid; It has a large number of observations; It has a year variable in it; It has "pnl" in the name
  CorrectAnswer: It has multiple rows per distid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='It has multiple rows per distid')
  Hint: Panel data has multiple observations per value of an identifier variable

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use vtable() with the lush = TRUE option to look at the variables more closely, including the number of unique values each variable takes (nuniq)
  CorrectAnswer: vtable(mathpnl, lush = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vtable(mathpnl, lush = TRUE)') | omnitest(correctExpr='mathpnl %>% vtable(lush = TRUE)')
  Hint: Send mathpnl to vtable, and set the lush option to TRUE.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: |- 
   Panel data is often described as "N by T". That is, the number of different individuals N and the number of time periods T.
   
   What is N in this data?
  CorrectAnswer: 550
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 550)
  Hint: Look at the number of unique values that distid takes

- Class: exact_question
  Output: |- 
   What is T in this data?
  CorrectAnswer: 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 7)
  Hint: Look at the number of unique values that year takes


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   A *balanced* panel is one in which each individual shows up in every single time period.
   
   We can check if this data is balanced by calculating nuniq (from **vtable**) for each distid, and checking that they're all 7.
   
   Use the following code to create the variable num_years, with the number of different year values that show up for each distid.
   
   nyrs <- mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% summarize(num_years = nuniq(year)) 
  CorrectAnswer: nyrs <- mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% summarize(num_years = nuniq(year)) 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='nyrs <- mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% summarize(num_years = nuniq(year)) ')
  Hint: Copy/paste the code.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now use table() with nyrs %>% pull(num_years) to see the different values that num_years takes.
  CorrectAnswer: nyrs %>% pull(num_years) %>% table()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('nyrs %>% pull(num_years) %>% table()','table(nyrs %>% pull(num_years))','table(nyrs$num_years)')
  Hint: Take nyrs %>% pull(num_years), which gives you the num_years variable, and send that to table()

- Class: mult_question
  Output:    |-
      If T is 7, and num_years only ever takes the value 7 for every distid, then the data is balanced!
      
      Do we have a balanced panel?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: table() shows the different values a variable takes. If all the observations take a value of 7, it's balanced. Otherwise, it's not.

- Class: text
  Output: Note that even if we *didn't* have a balanced panel, fixed effects would still work. We'd just have a few other things to worry about.

- Class: figure
  Output: Take a look at these four graphs...
  Figure: spot_the_fe.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In which of those four graphs do the straight lines represent predicted values from the model math4 ~ expp with fixed effects for distid?
  AnswerChoices: Graph A; Graph B; Graph C; Graph D 
  CorrectAnswer: Graph D
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Graph D')
  Hint: In fixed effects, the different districts have lines with the same slope, but moving up and down.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Regress math4 on expp, with lunch added as a control. Store the result as ols.
  CorrectAnswer: ols <- lm(math4 ~ expp + lunch, data = mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('ols'),cor(predict(ols),predict(lm(math4 ~ expp + lunch, data = mathpnl))) > .99,FALSE)
  Hint: Run a regular lm() regression, with no fixed effects, of math4 on expp and lunch

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now we will perform fixed effects by de-meaning the data.
   
   We can use group_by(distid) to perform calculations within distid
   
   and x = x - mean(x) to subtract the individual mean from x.
   
   For example
   
   mathpnl_dm <- mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% mutate(x_dm = x - mean(x), y_dm = y - mean(y))
   
   Would create mathpnl_dm with a new variable x_dm that is the de-meaned x and a new variable y_dm that is the de-meaned y.
   
   Create mathpnl_dm with de-meaned math4, expp, and lunch, called math4_dm, expp_dm, and lunch_dm, respectively.
  CorrectAnswer: mathpnl_dm <- mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% mutate(math4_dm = math4 - mean(math4), expp_dm = expp - mean(expp), lunch_dm = lunch - mean(lunch))
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('mathpnl_dm'),cor(mathpnl_dm[['math4_dm']],mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% mutate(x = math4 - mean(math4)) %>% pull(x)) > .99 & cor(mathpnl_dm[['expp_dm']], mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% mutate(x = expp - mean(expp)) %>% pull(x)) > .99 &  cor(mathpnl_dm[['lunch_dm']], mathpnl %>% group_by(distid) %>% mutate(x = lunch - mean(lunch)) %>% pull(x)) > .99, FALSE)
  Hint: Take the provided code and replace x with math4, y with expp, and make a similar line for lunch.

- Class: text
  Output: (by the way, the next time you have to do the same calculation to a bunch of different variables in dplyr, try looking at the across() function to save yourself some time!)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Regress math4_dm on expp_dm with lunch_dm as a control, and save the result as fe_dm
  CorrectAnswer: fe_dm <- lm(math4_dm ~ expp_dm + lunch_dm, data = mathpnl_dm)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('fe_dm'),cor(predict(fe_dm),predict(lm(math4_dm ~ expp_dm + lunch_dm, data = mathpnl_dm))) > .99, FALSE)
  Hint: Just run a regression as normal. Don't forget to use the mathpnl_dm data!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use export_summs() to look at both ols and fe_dm, with the digits = 3 option.
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(ols, fe_dm, digits = 3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='export_summs(ols, fe_dm, digits = 3)')
  Hint: Pass ols and fe_dm to the same export_summs() call. Don't forget digits = 3!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
   What is the appropriate interpretation of the 0.012 in the table?
   
   (Hint: be sure you know the scale of your variables! Check back at the vtable output in the Viewer tab to see what scale the variables are on)
  AnswerChoices: A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have 1.2 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than another school with $1 less; A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have 1.2 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than that same school in another year where expenditure is $1 lower; A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have .012 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than another school with $1 less; A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have .012 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than that same school in another year where expenditure is $1 lower
  CorrectAnswer: A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have .012 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than that same school in another year where expenditure is $1 lower
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A school with $1 more expenditure per student will have .012 percent more 4th graders at acceptable than that same school in another year where expenditure is $1 lower')
  Hint: math4 is on a 0-100 scale, not 0-1. So a one-unit change is 1 percentage point. Also, since we have fixed effects, we are always comparing a school to itself.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |- 
   Now we'll forget the de-meaning for a moment and use the least squares dummy variable model.
   
   Regress math4 on expp, lunch, and factor(distid) and store the result as fe_lsdv.
   
   This (and the linearHypothesis in the next step) might take a while - LSDV can be very slow!
  CorrectAnswer: fe_lsdv <- lm(math4 ~ expp + lunch + factor(distid), data = mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('fe_lsdv'),cor(predict(fe_lsdv),predict(lm(math4 ~ expp + lunch + factor(distid), data = mathpnl))) > .99, FALSE)
  Hint: Just do a regular regression and add +factor(distid) into it.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   One benefit of the LSDV approach is that we can test if the fixed effects are themselves significant.
   
   Do
   
   linearHypothesis(fe_lsdv, matchCoefs(fe_lsdv, 'distid'))
   
   to see if you can reject that the intercept is the same for all districts.
   
   NOTE: Mac computers seem to have difficulty processing this giant test. If you're using a mac, just answer 'mac' with the quotes to go to the next question.
  CorrectAnswer: linearHypothesis(fe_lsdv, matchCoefs(fe_lsdv, "distid"))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('linearHypothesis(fe_lsdv, matchCoefs(fe_lsdv, "distid"))','"mac"')
  Hint: Just copy/paste the code.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
   The output of the test is:
   
   Model 1: restricted model
   Model 2: math4 ~ expp + lunch + factor(distid)
   
   Res.Df    RSS  Df Sum of Sq      F    Pr(>F)    
   1   3847 882322                                   
   2   3298 408135 549    474186 6.9795 < 2.2e-16 ***
   
   Can we reject that the intercept is the same for all districts at the 1% level?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: If the p-value is below .01, we can reject.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Now we will do fixed effects using a specially-made function.
   
   Do help(lm_robust) to look at the syntax for the lm_robust function, paying attention to the fixed_effects option.
  CorrectAnswer: help(lm_robust)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(lm_robust)')
  Hint: Just do help(lm_robust)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Use lm_robust() to run regress math4 on expp and lunch, with distid as fixed effects. Store the result as fe_robust
   
   Don't forget to put a ~ before distid.
  CorrectAnswer: fe_robust <- lm_robust(math4 ~ expp + lunch, fixed_effects = ~distid, data = mathpnl)
  AnswerTests: ifelse(exists('fe_robust'),cor(fe_robust$fitted.values,lm_robust(math4 ~ expp + lunch, fixed_effects = ~distid, data = mathpnl)$fitted.values) > .99, FALSE); expr_uses_func('lm_robust')
  Hint: lm_robust() takes a regular formula and data= argument, just like lm(). Now just add fixed_effects = ~distid

- Class: text
  Output: |-
   As an aside, it is common to expect that the model's error terms might be correlated with each other within individual. This violates an OLS assumption, and would make your standard errors wrong!
   
   We can adjust for this using "cluster-robust standard errors", much like with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. To do this, we only need to add
   
   clusters = identifier
   
   as an option. So a cluster-robust version of our analysis might look like:
   
   fe_cluster <- lm_robust(math4 ~ expp + lunch, fixed_effects = ~distid, clusters = distid, data = mathpnl)
   
   Something to keep in mind!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Use export_summs to look at the results for ols, fe_dm, fe_lsdv, and fe_robust all together.
   
   Include the options
   
   digits = 3
   
   and (so all the dummy coefficients from fe_lsdv don't show up)
   
   coefs = c('expp','expp_dm','lunch','lunch_dm')
  CorrectAnswer: export_summs(ols, fe_dm, fe_lsdv, fe_robust, digits = 3, coefs = c('expp','expp_dm','lunch','lunch_dm'))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='export_summs(ols, fe_dm, fe_lsdv, fe_robust, digits = 3, coefs = c("expp","expp_dm","lunch","lunch_dm"))')
  Hint: Do export_summs() as normal, feeding in all four regression objects (in that order), and add the digits = 3 and coefs = c('expp','expp_dm','lunch','lunch_dm') options.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
   Finally, use the same code you just had but with plot_coefs(), and remove the digits = 3 argument, so you can see the coefficients from the different models against each other. (Should be a lot of similarities!)
  CorrectAnswer: plot_coefs(ols, fe_dm, fe_lsdv, fe_robust, coefs = c('expp','expp_dm','lunch','lunch_dm'))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot_coefs(ols, fe_dm, fe_lsdv, fe_robust, coefs = c("expp","expp_dm","lunch","lunch_dm"))')
  Hint: Take the export_summs() code from last time, remove "digits = 3,", and change export_summs to plot_coefs
